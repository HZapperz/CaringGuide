# Git Guidelines

```
What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to manage and track changes to their code. Git is designed to help multiple people work on the same codebase and keep track of who made what changes.

## Caring Guide Branching Strategy
For the development of Caring Guide, the strategy goes as follows. 
There is the "main" branch and "dev" branch. 
- The main branch will be the "releases". The only people allowed to push to main are execs. 
- The dev branch is where the new "features" assigned to you will be merged into. 
- For every feature, see the [GitHub-Project](https://github.com/orgs/Kappa-Theta-Pi-UTD/projects/8/views/1), there will be a feature which will then get merged to dev by "PR" which can only be approved by the execs once again.
